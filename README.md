# React-Redux-Markdown-Viewer

This is a toy application to play with React and Redux making a snappy web
application pretty easily.

To work with the application, you will need to first set it up:

```
$ npm install
$ webpack
```

Once this is done, you can test it with:

```
$ npm run test
```

Or you can play with it at http:127.0.0.1:8080 by running in two terminals:

```
$ npm run server
```

and

```
$ webpack-dev-server
```

This is about all that's there for now. More tests to come and more actions
maybe. Like I said, this is a toy project to learn some of these things.
